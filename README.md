STARTUP SAGA - A BUG IN A STARTUP
The problem TechX solves
In just four months, the world has been transformed. The COVID pandemic is an unprecedented and growing global crisis with devastating health, economic and social impact in every country. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are changing their business models in order to adapt to this changing environment. And the most important step in this direction is digitalization.
We intend to solve this problem by creating a service-based solution for firms to rapidly digitalize them and provide them with a fast, secure, reliable portal where they keep track of their tasks, and financial transactions. The Admin will be provided with all the tools like stats of employees, project reports, access to financial transactions kept on the blockchain.

Approach:
We will create a login/signup portal using ReactJS and connect it to the Mongo database using our Backend running on Express JS where everything from admin data, employee data, and employee the task will be stored. And we will connect our Frontend with Tezos blockchain where we will store confidential information like financial transactions.

Challenges we ran into
We made two models admin and employee, So in the admin model, there will be two data (1st data of admin itself and 2nd will be of employees who got hired by admin). We defined schema for the employee model. we added employee data in the admin model but then we have to add that in employee collection also. Then we solved this by using the internet.

Technologies we used
MongoDB
reactjs
Express js
Tezos Blockchain
React Three Fiber
